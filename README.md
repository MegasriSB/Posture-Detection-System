As a way of monitoring body posture and correcting it for individuals, postural recognition devices have become more common over the last few years. The use of a flex sensor, a thin strip of material that changes resistance as it is bent, is one promising approach to detecting posture. The sensor is connected to an Arduino UNO, which processes the sensor data, alerts the user when poor posture is detected, and gives the statistical report through a website. The accuracy of the system depends on several factors, including the positioning of the sensor, the calibration of the Arduino UNO, and the ability of the user to interpret and act on the alerts. The system can be customized to suit individual needs, and the alerts can be adjusted to suit the user's preferences. Potential applications of a posture detection system using a flex sensor include healthcare, ergonomics, and sports. In healthcare, the system can be used to monitor the posture of patients recovering from injuries or those with chronic pain. In ergonomics, the system can be used to monitor the posture of workers who spend extended periods sitting at a desk. In sports, the system can be used to monitor the posture of athletes during training to prevent injuries. The use of Flex sensors for posture detection systems has not yet been introduced, but early trials have shown promising results. However, before the technology can be developed to its full potential, it is necessary to address issues like the need for a portable and easy-to-use system. Finally, a system of posture recognition using the Flex sensor could be an effective tool to support good posture as well as reduce the risk for musculoskeletal disorders. With further development and refinement, the technology could have significant implications for healthcare, ergonomics, and sports.
